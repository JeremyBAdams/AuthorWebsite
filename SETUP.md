# SETUP

This file contains the commands that were issued to install dependencies on the web server

### PostgreSQL


### Python

##### python installation

The website was developed using [Python](https://www.python.org/) version [3.6.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/). Gzipped tarball source was copied to the PYTHON_DIR directory, then unpacked and installed via the following commands:
```
PYTHON_DIR=${HOME_DIRECTORY/my-software/python}
gunzip Python-3.6.3.tgz
tar -xvf Python-3.6.3.tar
cd Python-3.6.3
./configure --prefix=${PYTHON_DIR}
make altinstall
```
Symbolic links of pip and python executables were made in the bin directory, and this directory was added to the PATH environment variable in .bashrc
```
ln -s python3.6 python
ln -s pip3.6 pip
```

##### virtualenv installation

The website achieves python package dependency virtualization via [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) module. To set up isolated dependency environment, create the following directory structure:
```
VIRTUAL_ENV=${HOME_DIRECTORY}/my-software/python-virtual-envs/author-website
mkdir ${VIRTUAL_ENV}
pip install --install-option="--prefix=${PYTHON_DIR}" virtualenv
virtualenv ${VIRTUAL_ENV}
```

##### virtualenv activation

Once the python virtual environment has been installed, it is time to activate it, and install dependencies within it
```
cd ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/bin
source activate
```

##### python dependencies

With the author-website virtual environment activated, python dependencies can be installed via one of two methods:
1. using the requirements.txt file in this repository (generated by "pip freeze")
2. the install commands below
```
pip install django
pip install mysqlclient
```
